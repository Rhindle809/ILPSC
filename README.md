# ILPSC
Digital signage solution for low end raspberry pi models

# Why?
I have a series of Raspberry Pi Model Zeros that I need to display daily announcements on wall mounted TVs. After some initial testing and tutorials found online, I found that any Chromium based solution uses all of the system's available RAM, and ready made solutions such as Screenly OSE, though elegant and powerful, use all of the system's RAM in addition to pinning CPU usage at 100%. This renders the system completely unusable and unreachable, so I decided to write my own solution: Incredibly Low Powered Screen Controller. Setup will be the same no matter the model of Pi, though this project is aimed at the extremely low powered devices.

# How?
1. Start with a fresh install of Raspberry Pi OS Lite
2. Perform all initial setup with raspi-config. This varies wildly depending on your environment, I can't tell you exactly what to do; the only important settings are that the system automatically logs in to the terminal as the default pi user(though you can set any password you like), screen blanking is turned off, and the system is reachable via SSH.
3. Copy over the entire ILPSC directory to pi's home directory
4. Make installScript executable and run it. This will update the system and install everything you need
5. On reboot, use slideUpateBasic(text only) or slideUpdate(with menus) to set a slide.
6. To change the slide, run slideUpdate or slideUpdateBasic again and wait for the system to reboot
7. Enjoy

# I have a hundred Raspberry Pis, this seems like it will be a lot of work to update them all
Included in the folder localMachine is a script for any Linux based machine(endpoint or script-server) you plan to update your screens from. Replace ENTERSSHPASS with the SSH password of your Raspberry Pi and replace REMOTEIP with the IP address of your Raspberry Pi. This script can go on as long as you need it to; i've only made a generic version of my company specific, five Pi script and commented out all but one machine, but theoretically you could update any number of machines. The script requires the sshpass package on your local machine to run.

# Other Stuff
To change the default splash screen, drop your image in /etc/ and rename it splash.png<br/>
Leave the ILPSC directory available and intact, the system relies on it<br/>
This whole system has a hard dependency on the UZBL browser, other packages *may* work with tweaking, but everything is built around UZBL. Unfortunately the UZBL project is ostensibly abandoned and not available in Bullseye. You'll need to be running on top of Buster or navigate building UZBL from source.
